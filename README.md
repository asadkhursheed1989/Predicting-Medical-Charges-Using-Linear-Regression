Case Study: Predicting Medical Charges Using Linear Regression 
Objective: 
Develop a predictive model to estimate individual medical charges based on personal attributes 
using linear regression.

The dataset comprises several features:
• age: Age of the individual.
• sex: Gender (male/female).
• bmi: Body Mass Index.
• children: Number of children/dependents.
• smoker: Smoking status (yes/no).
• region: Geographical region.
• charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
 
Tasks: 


1. Handle missing or anomalous data.
2. Convert categorical variables (sex, smoker, region) into numerical formats using 
encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding).
3. Normalize/standardize numerical features if required.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Analyze the distribution of key variables (e.g., age, bmi, charges).
2. Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
3. Identify potential outliers or influential points.
Model Development:
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Implement a linear regression model.
3. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared 
Error).
Model Interpretation:
1. Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model.
2. Discuss the impact of different features on medical charges.
